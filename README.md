# 🏢 Smart HVAC Energy & Maintenance Ticketing System

> AI-powered HVAC monitoring platform for predictive maintenance and building energy analytics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart HVAC Energy & Maintenance Ticketing System** is an AI-driven platform designed to improve HVAC monitoring by combining **fault detection** and **energy consumption prediction** into a single intelligent dashboard.

The system continuously analyzes HVAC sensor readings, predicts equipment health, estimates building energy consumption, and generates maintenance recommendations through an interactive web dashboard.

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can be integrated into Building Management Systems (BMS) to enable predictive maintenance and improve operational efficiency.
